        Often the same specification is listed several
        times. This is because it can have different values for different watches. If you select the 
        same specification several times, watches that match either one of the values will be part of the result.

        <b>Example:</b>
        The activity profile specification productSpecAPMultisport, which you will see by expanding Activity profiles below, has three values:
        <ul>
            <li>Swimming/Running, Triathlon</li>
            <li>Triathlon</li>
            <li>Swimming/Running</li>
        </ul>

        If you check all three, it means that you are interested in a watch that has the productSpecAPMultisport 
        with any of those values.

        When you have selected all the specifications and values you require, you shold scroll
        down to the bottom of the page and press the "Lookup products" button.
        This will list all the products that has all the specifications you have selected.

    <b>Example (continued):</b>
        To lookup watches that also support VO2 max, open the Training, Planning and Analysis Features section and check productSpecV02Max. Note that there is also a productSpecV02MaxTrail specification. If you want to find the watches that support both, you must check both checkboxes. Note that you will probably also want to check the box for the productSpecFeaturePowerMeterComp specification, as you can only get you VO2 max for cycling if you have a power meter and the watch can communicate with it. You will find that specification in the Cycling Features section.
