# The long story

I have always been interesting in heart rate training. I remember my father had a Polar watch which made a small beep if he trained to hard.

Later I decided to <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/corrate/id1014082292" target="_blank">make an app</a> that would tell my heart rate by voice.

I then heard about VO2 max. A friend told me that the norwegian skier Bjørn Dæhli was known to have had the highest VO2 max ever measured: 96. Now I see that there is somewhere else above him, at least according to <a href="https://www.topendsports.com/testing/records/vo2max.htm" target="_blank">this list</a>.

When I heard that watches started to be able to measure VO2 max, I decided to look for one. I had experience with a Forerunner 201, which I guess was one of the smallest gps watches at its time, and decided to have a look on what their watches looked like today.

That is when I discovered they had increased their number of watch models quite a lot, to my counting 114 to be exact.

My requirement was that it should support VO2 max. I prefer to buy products that serves my needs without to much uneccessary functionality. But to my frustration I could not find an easy way to see which watches supported VO2 max. After some searching on the internet I found out that the Forerunner 245 was a low end watch supporting VO2 max. And I bought one.

It was fun to get a number on my VO2 max and it motivated me to try to increase it. When spring came I started to bicycle to work, but noticed that the watch did not want to give me my VO2 max anymore. It turned out that you needed a power meter on the pedals to get it. And that makes sense I guess, since I could have been cycling downhill in an incredible speed which would have fooled the VO2 measurement otherwise. A power meter for pedals is quite expensive, so I did not buy one. But, when I tried cycling indoor at the local gym, I could see that the bike measured the power and that it supported connections to external watches. There was only one problem, my watch could not find the power meter. The reason was that the 245 watch does not support power meters.

That was a bit frustrating and I became more or less obsessed by making it work and wrote <a href="https://forums.garmin.com/apps-software/mobile-apps-web/f/garmin-connect-web/360004/navigating-garmin-s-watch-selection-maze-a-frustrated-consumer-s-journey" target="_blank">a post in the Garmin forum.</a>

Even though the other Garmin users there pointed me in the right direction, I could not find an easy way to see which watches supported power meters/VO2 max. I figured out that since Garmin had nice pages with specifications for each watch, I could download all of them and using a computer program to figure out what would be the best buy for me. The result is <a href="https://www.erlendthune.com/garmin" target="_blank">this wizard</a>. It made me realize that Garmin differ between VO2 max when running flat and when running on a trail. But for some reason they do not list <i>VO2 max cycling</i> as a separate specification. You have to look for watches having the power meter compatibility specification to see which watches support VO2 max for cycling.

My problem now is that I have discovered that Garmin watches have a total of 400 specifications divided on the watches, and many of the specifications sounds intriguing. Furthermore, the watches do not let you log all sports. The Forerunner 245 does not allow you to log cross country skiing f.ex. If you sync with strava you would have to change the activity type after it has been uploaded there. And open water swimming is not supported either. So in the end you will end up by buying their most expensive watch, if you keep ticking of specifications on the wizard I created.

I hope you find the wizard useful!
