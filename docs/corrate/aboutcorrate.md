# About Corrate

I made the app Corrate, a Heart Rate Training (HRT) app for iphone/ipad to manage to stay in the right heart rate zones when training or competing. Provided you have a bluetooth smart heart rate sensor connected, the app will use synthetic speech to announce your heart rate as often as you like. You can choose whether you want the reading to be heartbeats per minute or the percentage of your maximum heart rate. The synthetic speech takes away the need of looking at a display to know your heart rate. Instead you can use your ears to get this information and concentrate your eyes elsewhere. The app is free, but you will be presented with an option to buy it every time you open it after you have used it 10 times. 

You can download the app here: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/corrate/id1014082292
