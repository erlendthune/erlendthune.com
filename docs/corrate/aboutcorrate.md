# About Corrate

Train smarter with HRT! Get real-time audio heart rate updates, Fartlek training, and recovery tracking. Stay in the right zone for peak performance! The app also features a Fartlek training program. This is a fun way of doing intervals.

I made the app Corrate, a Heart Rate Training (HRT) app for iphone/ipad to manage to stay in the right heart rate zones when training or competing. Provided you have a bluetooth smart heart rate sensor connected, the app will use synthetic speech to announce your heart rate as often as you like. You can choose whether you want the reading to be heartbeats per minute or the percentage of your maximum heart rate. The synthetic speech takes away the need of looking at a display to know your heart rate. Instead you can use your ears to get this information and concentrate your eyes elsewhere. 

You can download the app here: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/corrate/id1014082292

You will find many articles describing how to do heart rate training on the internet, by searching for ”Heart Rate Training” for example. The main idea is that you get different results depending on what heart rate you have compared to your maximum heart rate. When competing, staying in an elevated heart rate zone too long can decrease your performance. One of the advantages with the HRT app is that you can select how often you want to be alerted and be able to adapt your performance immediately. The app is easy to use and is as suitable for professional athletes as for amateurs. The app also features a customizable heart rate recovery mechanism. Measure how fast your heart rate drops after training. It is normally considered to be a sign of improving physical condition if your heart rate drops faster.

The app is free. If you use it more than 10 times, a dialog box will be displayed giving you the option to support the development of the app. You can continue to use the app for free by dismissing the dialog box. After an hour you will also hear a short audio message asking you to buy the app such that my wife can buy herself new shoes. This message will then be announced gradually more often, finally every 10 minutes.
