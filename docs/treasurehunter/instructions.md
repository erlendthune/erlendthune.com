## How to Create a Treasure Hunt

1. **Print and Prepare QR Codes**
   You can use any QR codes. I have made some you can  
   download and print: [QR codes PDF](/pdf/qrcodes.pdf).  
   Cut out the QR codes with a pair of scissors.

2. **Hide the QR Codes**  
   Place a QR code in a recognizable location (for example, by the television).  
   Scan the QR code and take a photo of the location.  
   Click "Save as hunt location" to store the step. The image and code are saved locally in your browser.

3. **Add More Steps**   
   Repeat step 2 as many times you like. Finish by taking a snapshot of the treasure location and press "Save as final treasure". 
   _Tip: You do not need to put or scan a QR code in the treasure location_

## How to Do the Treasure Hunt

1. Open the [standalone QR scanner page](/qr-scanner) on the same device you used to create the treasure hunt. (This is important, as the images are saved locally in your browser.)
2. Select if you want to perform the treasure hunt in the order you have decided or if it should be random.
3. Press the "Start" button. The image revealing where the first QR code is hidden is shown. Give the device to the treasure hunter. He/she should find it and scan it.  
4. Each time a QR code is scanned, the image of the next location will be displayed, guiding the treasure hunter on his/her way to the treasure.

Enjoy your treasure hunt!
