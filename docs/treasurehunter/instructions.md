## Create Treasure Hunt

On the next page you should: 
   - Enter a step number (for example, `1`, `2`, `3`, etc.) in the QR code field. This number will be used as the QR code value.
   - Upload an image that should be shown when this QR code is scanned.
   - Click "Save QR-code and image" to save the entry. The image and code are stored locally in your browser.
   - _Tip: The last image you add should reveal where the treasure is hidden!_

You can add as many QR codes and images as you like. All data is stored locally in your browser and will be available as long as you do not clear your browser storage.


## Do the Treasure Hunt

   - Open the [standalone QR scanner page](/qr-scanner) on the same device as you created the treasure hunt. This is important since the images are saved locally in the browser.
   - Scan a QR code with the value you entered above (for example, `1`).
   - If the code matches, the corresponding image will be displayed.
