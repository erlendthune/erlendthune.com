## How to Create a Treasure Hunt

1. **Print and Prepare QR Codes**  
   Download and print the QR codes from this PDF: [QR codes PDF](/pdf/qrcodes.pdf).  
   Cut out the QR codes. Set aside QR code 1â€”this will be the code the treasure hunter scans to start the hunt.

2. **Hide the QR Codes**  
   Place QR code 2 in a recognizable location (for example, by the television).  
   On the next page, enter the QR code number (e.g., `1` for the first step). Take a photo of the location where you placed QR code 2 and upload it.  
   Click "Save QR-code and image" to store the step. The image and code are saved locally in your browser.

3. **Add More Steps**  
   Place QR code 3 in another location (for example, in the fridge). Take a photo and upload it with QR code 2 as the step number.  
   Repeat for as many steps as you like.  
   _Tip: The last image you add should reveal where the treasure is hidden!_

## How to Do the Treasure Hunt

1. Open the [standalone QR scanner page](/qr-scanner) on the same device you used to create the treasure hunt. (This is important, as the images are saved locally in your browser.)
2. Scan QR code 1 to start.  
3. Each time a QR code is scanned, the corresponding image will be displayed, guiding the treasure hunter to the next location.

Enjoy your treasure hunt!
